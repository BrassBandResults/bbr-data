  <notes>4 bands competed.

1st prize: Â£4.

The 1908 Cornet annual records Mon 9th Sep, but a local newspaper report and an original winners&#39; certificate are both very clear that the date was Tue 10th Sep. The annual also records Kidlington&#39;s conductor as F. Webb, but the winners&#39; certificate records it as H. Taylor.
The contest closed with the 6 bands present between the two sections performing massed and also each giving a selection on their own.</notes>
