Horticultural Show and Band Contest - Gomersal
BIRSTAL AND GOMERSAL HORTICULTURAL SHOW. 
The twenty-sixth annual exhibition of the above society took place in Mr. Knowles&#39; park, Gomersal. It was a subject of regret by the supporters of the society that there was not a large gathering of the public, for by way of affording an additional attraction a brass band contest was announced to take place, but the weather was so threatening and the grass so wet with recent rain, that but few people liked to run the risk of getting cold. The bands present were the Dewsbury Old Band, Spinkwell and Calder Mills, and Heckmondwike Albion. 

Brass Band Contest - Mr. John Elwood, of Manchester, officiated as judge, and he made the following award: - 1st prize, £10, Dewsbury Old Band; 2nd, £6, Heckmondwike Albion Band; 3rd, £3, Spinkwell Mills (Dewsbury) Band. The last two bands had to play off for second place.</notes>
