Agricultural Show + Band Contest - Guiseley
The seventeenth annual exhibition of the Guiseley Agricultural Society took place, and notwithstanding heavy rain which fell throughout the afternoon, there was a large number of visitors. 
A great attraction to the show was a brass band contest,which had been arranged for, but the unfavourable weather and the damp and soft state of the ground marred the enjoyment which would otherwise have been experienced. Six bands - Kirkstall, Farnley, Ingledew&#39;s (Leeds), Heckmondwike, Baildon, and Dodsworth&#39;s (Bradford) competed for the various prizes, which were awarded by the judge, Mr. A. Koenig, bandmaster of the 13th Hussars, York, as follows: - First (£I2) Kirkstall, second (£6) Heckmondwike, third (£4) Dodsworth&#39;s. A bugle for the best cornet player was won by Mr. H. Jackson, leader of the Kirkstall band.
