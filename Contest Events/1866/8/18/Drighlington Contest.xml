Horticultural Show and Band Contest - Drighlington
The twelfth annual exhibition of the Drighlington and Adwalton Agricultural and Floral Society was held in a field at the former place, lent for the occasion by Mr. John Hague, of Crow Nest, Dewsbury. There was a total absence of cattle and sheep, but in other classes the entries were numerous. 

In the afternoon and evening a brass hand contest took place on the ground, for which five bands entered. The judges were Mr. George Haddock, of Leeds, and Mr. Samuel Naylor, of Adwalton; and they awarded the first prize (£12 and a silver cup, value £5 5s, for the band-master) to the Heckmondwike Albion; second (£8), Dewsbury Old Band; third (£4), Frawdon Band, Colne. The attendance was very large.</notes>
