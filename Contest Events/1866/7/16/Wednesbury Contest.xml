Gala + Band Contest - The Mounts, Wednesbury
A Band Contest took place at Wednesbury, at the conclusion of which the judge, Mr. D. Godfrey, of the Grenadier Guards, before announcing his decision, delivered a short address to the assembled bands, in the course of which he remarked that he had no knowledge of any of the bands competing, or the order in which they played, his decision therefore would be given entirely without bias or prejudice, and he bad no difficulty whatever in arriving at the following conclusion: 

1st CLASS. 
1st prize - Matlock Rifle Corps - £15 
2nd - Chesterfield - £8 
3rd - Great Bridge Havelock - £4 
Lichfield Rifle Corps 
Etruria Artillery 

2nd CLASS {For bands formed within three years) 
1st prize - Clay Cross Rifle Corps - £8 
2nd - Lloyd&#39;s Axle and Tyre Works - £4 
3rd - Old Park Iron Works - £2 
Darlaston. 

With regard to the contest, Mr. Godfrey proceeded to say that some of the bands played exceedingly well, but he would venture to suggest to the second class that they were attempting to play selections of music too difficult for them. The Matlock band played the following selections: Herculaneum (F. David) and Macbeth (Briffaux). A prize cornet, valued at six guineas, was also competed for, and easily won by Mr. John Naylor, leader of the Matlock band. The following also competed: - Mr. Marriott (Etruria), Mr. Rogers (Lloyd&#39;s), Mr. Silvester (Great Bridge). Mr. Creswell (Old Park); and Mr. Bedsmore (Lichfield). We heartily congratulate the Matlock band on its victory - a victory indeed well deserved. Having, during the last two years, beaten every amateur band with which it has measured its strength, it may fairly claim to be one of the best in the provinces. Mr. Geo. Knowles, the band-master, has not only provided the band with first-class music, but also with the very best quality of instruments, manufactured by Mr. F. Besson, London, the best maker of the day.
