NOTICE OF CANCELLATION  - AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL BAND CHAMPIONSHIPS
The National Band Council of Australia has made the following statement--
Discussions were held with the National Band Council and the Western Australian organizing committee today following the announcement of a pandemic. It is with regret that the National Contest to be held in Perth (WA) at Easter will not proceed.
We are well aware of the amount of preparation that has been made by the organizing committee and individual bands. However, circumstances and concerns by various stakeholders have made us come to this decision  
This decision was not made lightly but was in the end forced upon us

Sincerely
Barrie Gott
President
