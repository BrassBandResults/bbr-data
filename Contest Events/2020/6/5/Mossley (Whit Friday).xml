Please read the statement below from our Chairman in relation to the 2020 Tameside competition:
“In light of the Government’s advice regarding large scale public gatherings and in order to protect both the banding community and the public at large, &#39;The Friends of Tameside Whit Friday Brass Band Contest Committee&#39;  have taken the unprecedented step to postpone the 2020 contest in Tameside until 2021.  
Whilst we want to apologise for any inconvenience this may causes, we can assure you all this decision has not been an easy one to make and has not been taken lightly.
We firmly believe the postponement is in the best interests of all groups involved; bands, organisers, volunteers and the wider public. 
The Whit Band contests are one of, if not the oldest brass competitions in the country and have been running for well over 140 years. This legacy and heritage of the event is of utmost importance to us and we will do everything we can to ensure the contests continue into 2021 and beyond.”
