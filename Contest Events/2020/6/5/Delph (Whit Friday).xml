Statement from Chairman, Bob Rogers, on behalf of the Saddleworth Area Contests:
“Following much soul searching and debate between the 11 Saddleworth and Oldham Whit Friday Contests, we have reluctantly decided that we must follow Government guidelines, and guidance from Brass Bands England,  and not hold the contest in 2020.  
We know that this is one of the highlights of the calendar not only for local people, but also for Brass Bands nationally and internationally.  We look forward to running a fantastic event on 28th May, 2021, and hope that everyone keeps safe throughout these unprecedented times.”</no-contest>
