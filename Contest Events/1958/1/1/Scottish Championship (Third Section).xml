  <no-contest>No contest took place in 1958 because the contest dates were changed to synchronise with those of other area qualifying rounds of the National Brass Band Championship of Great Britain. Until 1958, bands qualifying from the Scottish region were taken from the previous year&#39;s Scottish Championship contest. From 1959 onwards, they have been taken from the current year&#39;s contest, now run earlier in the year than formerly was the case.</no-contest>
