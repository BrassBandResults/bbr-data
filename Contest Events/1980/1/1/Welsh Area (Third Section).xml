  <no-contest>Due to a dispute with the National organiser, in 1980 the Welsh area was run unofficially, without accreditation to the national contest. The 1979 Welsh section winners were invited to the 1980 finals.
An account of events and the dispute is given at http://www.4barsrest.com/articles/2010/1102.asp?l=in#.Wh3ZQVVl-Uk.</no-contest>
