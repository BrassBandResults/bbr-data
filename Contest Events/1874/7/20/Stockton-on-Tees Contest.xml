Band Contest - Stockton-on-Tees
The annual band contest, under the auspices of the Stockton Excelsior Gala Company, was held in the Cricket Field, Oxbridge Lane. The attendance was excellent. Seven bands entered for the contest, out of which number only three put in an appearance; viz: Stockton Malleable Brass Band, of 20 performers, conducted by Mr John Cass; Fourth Durham (West Hartlepool) Artillery, 22 performers, conductor, Mr T. Hogg; and the Whitworth Brass Band, 20 performers, conductor, Mr T. Woods. The bands each played twice, and the judge awarded the prizes as follows: Fourth Durham, 1st £25; Whitworth, 2nd, £20; and Stockton, 3rd, £15. A silver cornet offered for the best cornet solo was awarded to Mr Sidney, out of seven competitors. Mr Kaine was a good second. C. Cousins, bandmaster, 2nd Queen&#39;s Bays, Leeds, the judge, said all the bands were so good that he had considerable difficulty in deciding between them, especially between the Fourth Durham and the Whitworth Bands. The playing of the Stockton Band was good, and would be better by and bye.
