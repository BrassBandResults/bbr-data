5 bands played.

After the bands had played the first pieces, the solo cornet contest took place for a desideratum cornet, value Â£10 10s, and made by Messrs Beeson and Co., the celebrated instrument makers. Eight competitors were entered, two of whom did not put in an appearance. The playing of Mr Sydney of West Hartlepool and Mr Milburn of Middlesbrough, was so equal, that the judges desired them to play over again. Their second performances were quite superior to their first, and the judges ultimately awarded the prize to Mr Milburn. There was also a silver cup, (given by Mr W. G. Collingwood) to be competed for by the euphonium players who had played in the band contest. Three competitors contested this, and Mr S. Ackroyd, of the Saltaire Band proved successful. The other two were Mr T. Henderson, Felling Band, and G. P. Wiseman, Whitworth Band.</notes>
