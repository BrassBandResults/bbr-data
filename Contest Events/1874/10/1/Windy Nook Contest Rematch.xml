  <notes>Referee: Thomas Hogg, of Hartlepool.

A rematch of the Windy Nook march contest of earlier in the year was arranged between the committees of these two bands, as recounted in &quot;The History of St. Hilda&#39;s Band&quot;. One judge was appointed by each band, and it was held on neutral ground. The format was identical to the earlier contest, with each band playing the same two own choice marches, and alternating performances, i.e. Dennison&#39;s played 1 and 3, while West Wylam played 2 and 4.</notes>
