  <notes>SOUTH SYDNEY WITHDREW: M. M Edwards (secretary ) said last night in view of the decision: &quot;It has been unanimously decided by the band to take no further part in the contest. When we went to Ballarat in October, under one of the best judges in Australia we secured 6 points off possible; here we are awarded 59 points off possible. We intend to challenge the winners at the conclusion of the contest.&quot;

IN REPLY: South Sydney have announced their withdrawal owing to dissatisfaction with the award of the adjudicator. It is more likely, however an altogether different reason. As Secretary of the Band Association I officially notified the band at the conclusion of their playing on the first night I intended to lodge a protest on the grounds when called upon under contest rules one of their players refused to make a statutory declaration to the effect that the name he played under was his own and not a false one .
It was probably the fear of disqualification had more to do with the withdrawal than the award of the judge
