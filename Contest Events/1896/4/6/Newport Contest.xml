  <notes>Vochriw&#39;s performance was interrupted by discordant notes from players of the other bands who objected to their inclusion in the contest, as they felt Vochriw was of a higher rank and it was unfair competition. Following considerable uproar, the police were called, the hall cleared and the bands dispersed. Later Vochriw played the test piece and being the only band there, took home the prize
