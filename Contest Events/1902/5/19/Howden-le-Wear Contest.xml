I found more detail about this contest On Friday the 23rd May 1902 the Durham County Advertiser told that &quot;An attractive item in connexion with the Good Templars Gala at Howden-le-Wear, on Whit Monday, was the band contest for which £24 10s was offered for competition. Eleven bands entered, and all of them put in an appearance, the various efforts being attentively listened to by a large crowd of people. Each had the choice of playing either of the following three test pieces :- &quot;Euryanthe,&quot; &quot;Songs of Other Days,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare.&quot; The appointed judge was Mr Whipp, but two telegrams were received stating that he had missed his train service at two junctions. The committee then appointed Mr George Allan of New Shildon as judge, and Shildon Saxhorn, which he conducted, was not allowed to compete.&quot; - doesn&#39;t change the result but there was one other band there that didn&#39;t compete and we know why. I&#39;m part of a group championing George Allan and Thomas E Bulch - see www.wizardandtyphoon.org</notes>
