  <notes>Selection (test piece Apollo) plus own choice march.

March contest results:

- 1st Harton Colliery (J Oliver, &quot;Conquerer&quot;, Â£1 10s)
- 2nd South Shields Temperance (J W Taylor, &quot;BB and CF&quot;)

Mr Bower&#39;s adjudication of Harton Colliery&#39;s performance of Conquerer:

&quot;Splendid start; grand to listen to; Sop a little sharp on top notes; Sop again a little faulty; a grand brisk style; basses quite a feature and accompaniments very neat.  Trio:  Melody a little out of tune; you are too anxious; cornet entry good; perhaps the wind is interfering; it is rather boisterous [nb I think Mr Bower was actually referring to the wind with this comment - it is noted elsewhere that the conditions on the day were &quot;boisterous&quot;]; everthing good; p&#39;s and f&#39;s well observed; tone of band good.  Second time through much better and Sop improves; everything just now is grand; bass solo excellent.  A really splendid performance to a march you are equal to.&quot;
