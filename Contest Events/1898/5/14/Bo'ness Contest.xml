DISPUTE AMONG BRASS BANDS

An action of multiplepoinding has been raised at the Linlithgow Sherriff Court at the instance of the members of the Kinneil Band, real raisers and holders of the fund in medio, against the members of the Bo&#39;ness and Carriden, Alloa, Clydebank, Portobello, and Bonnybridge bands, which took part in the brass band contest at Kinneil House, Bo&#39;ness, on the 14th May last under the auspices of Kinneil Band. The result of the contest was - 1 Bo&#39;ness and Carriden ; 2 Alloa ; 3 Clydebank ; 4 Portobello. At the conclusion of the contest Alloa Band, along with Kinneil Band, entered a protest against Bo&#39;ness and Carriden Band on the ground that Mr Alexander Bell, one of the players of that band, was disqualified under the rules of the Scottish Brass Band Association in respect that he was not one of the registered players of that band. The action is raised in order to have it determined whether Bo&#39;ness and Carriden Band or Alloa Band is entitled to the first prize, which amounts to £20. and upon the settlement of this question depends the legitimate distribution of the whole prize money. which amounts in all to £44. Bo&#39;ness and Carriden Band denies the allegation that Mr Bell is not a registered player of the band.
