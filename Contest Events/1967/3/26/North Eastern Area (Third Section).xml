  <notes>After 1966, when the North Eastern Area was not run, but was replaced by the Yorkshire Brass Band Championships, both contests were run in 1967, with bands from this contest qualifying for the finals. The alternative Yorkshire area contest was held on 11th March at St. George&#39;s Hall, Bradford.</notes>
