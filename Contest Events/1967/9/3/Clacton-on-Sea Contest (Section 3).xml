Comment from Harwich member:

&quot;The 1967 Contest was an &#39;own choice&#39; piece and the Band used &#39;The Young In Heart&#39; which was composed by the late Albert Ball which and chosen by the Musical Director R.W.Wringe. What we did not know until we arrived at the venue and looked at the programme was that the Adjudicator was Albert Ball himself! He made some very nice comments in his summing up of the Band&#39;s performance, which comprised of three separate movements and it was the Band&#39;s first major contest success. All of the Band&#39;s who took part had their performances recorded by a recording company that was present and I still have a record of &#39;The Young In Heart&#39; that could be purchased from this recording company.&quot;</notes>
