29 June 1857
Band Contest - Zoological Gardens, Hull
THE BRASS BAND CONTEST AT HULL - On Monday morning, about half past ten o&#39;clock, several of the West Riding bands arrived. The following fifteen bands entered the contest, namely:- Hull Brunswick, Pudsey, Kingston Cotton Mill, Batley, Hunslet Leather Works, Woodhouse Victoria, Blundell, Spence, and Co.&#39;s, Low Moor Ironworks, Almondbury, Hull Druids, Huddersfield, Rothwell, Morley, Gawthorp , and the Flax and Cotton Mill. The judges were Mr. Deval, R.A.M.; Mr. Hunt, of York; Mr. J. Deacon, band master of the 2nd West York; and Mr. J. Wilson, band master of Astley&#39;s Hippodrome. 

The bands were required to play the &quot;Londesborough Galop&quot;, and any selected piece they pleased. Instead of twenty-nine bands, which were down in the list, only fifteen entered the arena, the &quot;Black-dyke band&quot;, which it was expected would have carried off the first prize, being barred. This band won the prize at Halifax on Saturday, and in consequence was objected to by the &quot;Batley band&quot;, which took the second prize. The judges awarded the first prize, (£12 with a cornet value 7 guineas) to the Morley band, who played a selection from &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and was conducted by Mr. J. Peel. The Batley band obtained the 2nd prize (£6); they gave a selection from &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;; leader, Mr. J. Farrar, conductor, Mr. R. Smith. The 3rd prize (£3) was awarded to the Huddersfield band; leader, Mr. F. Drake; an &quot;Operatic selection&quot; was given by this band. A bombardon, value (£12), was given by the managing secretaries to the Kingston Cotton Mill Band, it being the best belonging to Hull.
