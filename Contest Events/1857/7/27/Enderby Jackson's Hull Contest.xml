27 July 1857
First Class Band Contest - Zoological Gardens, Hull
The First Class Brass Band Contest took place on Monday afternoon, in the Hull Zoological Gardens, which were only thinly attended, compared with the former contest. Only seven bands competed, namely, the Fourth West York Rifles, Leeds Railway Foundry, Royal Wear Yacht Club (from Sunderland), Brighouse, Meltham Mills, Hunslet Spanish Leather Works, and Castleford Sax-horn. In addition to the music which each band had selected for itself, they were all required to play Flotow&#39;s grand overture to the opera of &quot; Stradella.&quot; At the conclusion of the contest, Mr. Jackson announced that the judges had awarded the 1st prize to the band of the Fourth West York Rifies; the 2nd to the Leeds Foundry band; the 3rd to the Sunderland band; and the 4th to the Brighouse band, with the remark that the judges spoke favourably of the other bands, which, with more practice, would soon equal their more fortunate competitors.</notes>
