  <notes>Il Trovatore plus own-choice test piece

In the first round, No. 1 band played a selection from Il Trovatore; No. 2, Rossini&#39;s Cujus animam; No. 3, a duet; and Nos. 4 and 5, selections from La Traviata. In the second round all the bands played the same piece, which was a selection from Il Trovatore. After the completion of the second round, Nos. 3 and 4 were requested to play a third piece each, the reason being, as we afterwards learned, that the judges had some difficulty in deciding which of the two ought to be placed second to the No. 1 band, whose playing they held to be the best. No. 3, accordingly, played the finale to Lucia di Lammermoor; and No. 4 a recitative from The Creation. The judges characterised the playing of this last piece by No. 4 as admirable, and were so pleased with the performance that they requested No. 1 to play a third piece also, in order to ascertain whether it, or No. 4, was entitled to the first prize, the playing of No. 1 (Smith&#39;s, Leeds) was again very excellent, and the judges felt bound to award it the first prize.
