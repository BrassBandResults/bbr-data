The Horticultural Show and Band Contest at Loughborough took place in the beautiful grounds connected with the Grammar School at that place. The flower show was a great success, but the band contest was a failure as regards the number of bands entered, only four entering the arena of competition, viz., Chesterfield, Matlock, Wednesbury, and Loughborough. The order of playing was as above described, and the selections were the same as at previous contests at Buxton and Leicester. The playing of the different bands was very good, and the judges (Mr. H. Farmer, of Nottingham, and Mr. Cradburn, organist, of Loughborough), gave their award as follows: Chesterfield, First Prize, £20; Matlock, Second, £10; Wednesbury, Third, £6; Loughborough, Fourth, £4</notes>
