Band Contest - Birkenhead Park
Wirral Farmers Club Autumn Show - Towards noon, however, the weather cleared up; in the afternoon the sun shone forth brilliantly and there was a large attendance of visitors. The ground, too, assumed quite an animated appearance, and there being a band contest, the excellent playing of the musicians contributed largely to the entertainment of the company. 1st (£5), 5th Cheshire Artillery Volunteers; 2nd (£3), 2nd Cheshire Rifle Volunteers; The sum of £2 was granted to the band belonging to the Liverpool South Corporation Schools</notes>
