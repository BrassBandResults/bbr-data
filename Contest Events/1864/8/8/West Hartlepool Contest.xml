Thousands of people flocked to the town from the various places in the neighbourhood to witness and listen to a musical contest; which took place in the New Market. At one o&#39;clock the Foresters&#39; Order, attired in their regalia, headed by bands of music, paraded the streets and drew up at the New Market, and at two Mr. James, bandmaster of the 8th Hussars, who officiated as judge, took his seat in a caravan, and the Trimdon band was the first to mount the platform to compete for the prizes, followed by the Middlesbro&#39;, West Hartlepool Operatic, Horsforth, Bradford, Leyburn, Fourth Durham Artillery, and Kirkstall bands. Each band performed two selections, and the result of the judge&#39;s decision was as follows: 1st, Kirkstall, near Leeds, £10; 2nd, Bradford, £5; 3rd, West Hartlepool, £3; and 4th, Leyburn, £2. The announcement was made by Mr. John Foxton, auctioneer, and it was received with acclamation. There, were thirty-three entries for solo playing, which would not be finished before a late hour.</notes>
