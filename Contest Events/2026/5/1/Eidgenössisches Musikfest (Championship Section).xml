  <notes>The various Contests were planned to happen on May 13th - 16th 2021 (exceptionally all on the same &quot;long&quot; Weekend). After COVID-19 and the following very uncertain Development and Discussions about an alternative/smaller Programme, all Contests had to be canceled completely finally.
See: https://www.emf2021.ch/

Then Interlaken was ready and quickly confirmed to be host on the next possible Date - in May 2026.
