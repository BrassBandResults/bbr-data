The first show in connection with the Richmond. Floral and Horticultural Society, was held in the beautiful grounds of the Temple, kindly granted for the occasion by Mr John Smurthwaite. The attendance was large, considering the disagreeable state of the weather, and during the day the show ground was patronised by the elite of the town and neighbourhood. The band contest for £40, which was decided during the afternoon, resulted in the success of the West Hartlepool Old Operatic Band, which was conducted by Mr J. Hogg. The pieces they performed. were &quot;Maritana&quot;, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot;, and the &quot;Amen Chorus&quot;. Middlesbrough Model Band was second, Reeth Volunteer Band third, and Richmond Borough Band fourth. After the contest the bands united, and played the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; and &quot;God Save the Queen.&quot;</notes>
