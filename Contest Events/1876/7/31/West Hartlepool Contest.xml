Band Contest - West Hartlepool
A brass band contest, organized. by Mr Thomas Hogg, the talented and enterprising conductor of the Old Operatic Band, of West Hartlepool, and formerly the band of the 4th Durham Artillery Volunteers, was held in that town, at .Mr A. B. Henderson&#39;s Recreation Grounds.Eight first-class bands had entered, but, owing to very unfavourable weather, only four put in an appearance, viz. Linthwaite, Leeds Model, Buttershaw Mills, and Whitworth. The attendance of the general public, from the same cause, was also very limited; and the venture, we are sorry to hear, will entail a loss to the promoters. At the conclusion of the contest, the Judge (Mr R. Smith, of Hull) awarded the prizes as follows: 1st, £15, Linthwaite; 2nd, £10, Buttershaw Mills; 3rd, £5, Leeds Model.</notes>
