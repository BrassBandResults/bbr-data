  <notes>It was a sad yet proud day for ten-year-old Kenneth Harkness, second cornet, and the youngest competitor in the Seaton (Workington) brass and silver band contest. His father had died only a few hours before he mounted the platform with the village band, which won a first, a second and fourth prize. When Mr Tom Eastwood, the adjudicator, praised him for his courage, Kenneth said: &quot;My dad knew he was dying, and told me, &#39;My boy, you must play to-day.&#39; While I was playing I kept saying to myself, &#39;I am playing for you, dad.&#39; The boy&#39;s father was a miner, aged thirty-three.</notes>
