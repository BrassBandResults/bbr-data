  <no-contest>The scheduled 1949 Australian championships event at Launceston, Tasmania was postponed firstly from the week commencing 14th November 1949 to 24th-28th December 1949, then further from there due to an outbreak of poliomyelitis, eventually being held in the following year, over Easter, 10th April 1950. As a result two Australian championship events were held in 1950, one designated for 1949, in April 1950, and one designated for 1950, in October 1950.</no-contest>
