Band Contest - Douglas, Isle of Man
The first athletic sports ever held at Douglas, Isle of Man, were in every way a great success, fully 3000 persons having assembled for the purpose of witnessing them. The first item on the programme was a brass band contest. The prizes were: first, £10; and second, £5. Messrs. Pew and Richardson, formerly of the Covent Garden Opera Company, and Mr. J. F. Cottier, formerly professor of music, Liverpool, officiated as judges. Only two bands contested, namely, the band of the West Derby (Liverpool) Volunteer Fire Brigade, and the Isle of Man Artillery Corps Band. The West Derby band was awarded the first, and the Manx band the second prize.</notes>
