Gala + Band Contest - Lofthouse in Cleveland
A grand brass band contest took place in the Hall Grounds, at Lofthouse. The Lofthouse people have a gala, on an extensive scale, every year, and generally a band contest, which usually attracts a large gathering, and yesterday was no exception to the rule. Cheap excursion trains were run from Halifax, &amp;c., to Saltburn-by-the-Sea, which at present is the nearest railway station. The committee offered four prizes; the first being £14 and a ten guinea cornet, embracing the latest improvements; £8 for the second; £6 for the third; and £2 for the fourth prize. Eight bands entered for competition, the whole of which contested. Each band performed one piece, of its own selection, and then the whole of the bands united, and played with wonderful precision, considering the immense number, &quot;The Heavens are telling.&quot; Another piece was then performed by each band, and the judge (Mr. Hy Milburn), declared Heckmondwike band 1st; Felling 2nd; Saltaire 3rd; and Bramley 4th. The unsuccessful bands were Chester-le-street, Stanhope, Marske, and Trimdon Colliery. The weather was all that could be wished, and the thousands present enjoyed themselves to their heart&#39;s content.</notes>
