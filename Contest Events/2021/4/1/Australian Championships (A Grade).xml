  <no-contest>Contests cancelled due to the still ongoing Covid-19- Pandemic, see NBCA Statement:

The National Band Council of Australia in conjunction with the Band Association of NSW will be conducting the inaugural Australian National Online Festival of Bands (ANOFOB) instead of the Australian National Band Championships which were to be held in Newcastle over Easter 2021. The NBCA would like to encourage all eligible bands to participate in this event under the conditions outlined in the press release.

This festival will provide an opportunity for bands to submit for adjudication video recordings of them playing a sacred item, single own choice major work, on stage march or own choice concert item (or any combination of these four items).
The festival is all about participation, providing bands with purpose for rehearsals through these times as we attempt to return to our usual high standards, making great music together rather than fierce competition for trophies and titles.


Contests originally planned for April 2nd - 5th.</no-contest>
