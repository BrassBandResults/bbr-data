  <notes>Scottish Amateur Band Association contest - open to the West of Scotland (second section). Five prize winners go forward to final in Dunfermline on 9th December 1921

12 bands competed.

Prizes: £12, £8, £6, £3, £1

After the contest a number of bands were disqualified:

Barrhead - for playing unregistered players
Greenfield - for playing a player registered with a 1st Section band
Bearmore Works - for playing a member who was under suspension.

As a result the bands which went forward to the final (representing the West of Scotland against the East of Scotland), were Shotts Foundry, St John&#39;s (Port Glasgow) and St Lawrence (Greenock)</notes>
