  <notes>This was the second of two contests on the same weekend in the same place with different titles and extremely similar (if not identical) results, both held as part of the Festival of Sligo.

It is possible that the two contests were held the other way round (Sun/Sat rather than Sat/Sun), and the format is unclear. Please advise if you know more.</notes>
