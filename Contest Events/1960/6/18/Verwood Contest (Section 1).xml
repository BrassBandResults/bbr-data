March Contest:

2 Handley

6 Alderholt
7 Southsea
W Woodfalls Juniors

Hymn Contest:
1 Alderholt
2 City of Oxford
3 Wincanton
4 Southsea
5 Salisbury
6? Woodfalls Juniors?
7 Handley
8 Wincanton? or Woodfalls Juniors?

The annotation on the programme giving the hymn results is rather confused, showing 7 placings against 8 bands, including 7th and 8th places, but not 6th. Woodfalls Juniors are specifically noted as withdrawn for the march, the results for which are recorded in the same table.

British Bandsman of 25/6/1960 shows winners of section 1 as Woodfalls Silver (C.A.Kingshott) then states - &#39;All the bands entered were present, but the Woodfalls players did not compete in the March section as they left immediately after playing in section 2 to give a programme at a garden fete 7 miles away, and returned to win the hymn tune section and section 1.

British Bandsman shows march result as - 1st Southsea 88 pts, 2nd City of Oxford 85, 3rd Handley 82. Hymn tune as Woodfalls uniors 81pts, 2nd City of Oxford 80, 3rd Handley 79. </notes>
