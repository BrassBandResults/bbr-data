The fourteenth annual brass band contest was held at this thriving and populous town, situated almost in the centre of the Cleveland mining district. The contest on Monday was more successful than any of the series, about 3,000 people being admitted to the picturesque grounds. Five bands entered for competition, three (Meltham, Guiseley, and Elland Upper Edge), being from the West Riding, while the other two were from Gateshead and Whitby. The judges awarded the prizes as follows: 1st prize, £20, Meltham Mills Band; 2nd, £10, Elland Band; 3rd, £5, Guiseley Band; 4th, £3, Gateshead Band.</notes>
