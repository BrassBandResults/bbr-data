Band Contest - Meltham
A brass band contest of an excellent description, and the judges of which were Mr. H. T. Farmer, of Nottingham, professor of music, and Mr. Hughes, of the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, came off at Meltham in connection with the brass band which hails from that place. Five money prizes were offered. namely, 1st £26; 2nd, £18; 3rd, £10; 4th, £5; and 5th, £3. Nine hands competed, and were each to have played two selections, but at the conclusion of the first round of playing the following bands were selected to play off for the prizes: Netherthong, bandmaster Mr. W. Battye; Saddleworth Rifle Band, conductor Mr. T. Jones; Linthwaite Band, bandmaster Mr. E. Swift; Holme Mills, conductor Mr. J. Sykes; and Leeds Model Band, conductor Mr. R. Smith. At the conclusion of the playing the various bands joined in playing the National Anthem. The judge gave the following decision as to the playing: 1st prize, Nelson; 2nd prize, Saltaire: 3rd prize, Leeds Model; 4th prize, Linthwaite; 5th prize, Holme Mills. A large number of people had assembled to listen to the music performed by the various bands, and when the contest had concluded they soon left the field in which it had taken place in order to take train to Huddersfield and other places. A man, whose name did not transpire, but who lives at Blackmoorfoot, was, about eight o&#39;clock, whilst the contest was proceeding, wrestling with another man, when he fell and got his leg broken. He was taken out of the field and had his injury attended to.
