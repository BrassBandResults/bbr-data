  <notes>Placings from British Bandsman, 16/4/1966. However, the 1966 National final had 4 bands from the North West - Skelmersdale, Ellesmere, Stacksteads and Poulton le Fylde, and Ellesmere were originally recorded 2nd in this BBR entry (and were the only band listed by the enterer). Does anybody know the story? Were Royal Buckley perhaps later disqualified?

Is &quot;On The Pier&quot; the correct test piece? Other areas used &quot;Everybody&#39;s Child&quot; by Eric Ball in the same year for the fourth section, and it isn&#39;t recorded anywhere else in the database.</notes>
