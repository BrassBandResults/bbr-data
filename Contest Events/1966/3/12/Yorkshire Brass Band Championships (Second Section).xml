  <notes>Statement from the 1966 Yorkshire Brass Band Committee, printed in the contest programme: 

&quot;When the sudden and rather distressing announcement was made in May of last year, that Messrs. Odhams Press Ltd. was to discontinue its active participation in the Area Contests, although they will still continue to present National Championships in London annually (see announcement on back page of this programme), we in Yorkshire were first to make it known that our Area Contests, so firmly established, would be continued—reverting to the original style and title as above. An appeal was made to all Yorkshire Bands for continued loyal support, and the Festival Committee is extremely gratified at the most wonderful response thereto, which has resulted in the magnificent entry of 55 Bands in these Championships—this in spite of the enormous increase in the cost of registration of players. All connected with Yorkshire Brass Bands can be justifiably proud of such an achievement. Congratulations are due to all.&quot; 

# List giving venue of London contests 

All the prize winners from the Yorkshire Brass Band Championships four section contests went forward to compete at the National Finals. 
The North Eastern Area Qualifying Contests were not held. 

Apparently all the trophies were withdrawn after the 1965 season and then redistributed for the 1966 contests; the championship section trophy previously used in Yorkshire went to the North West Area and the winners - CWS (Manchester)&#39;s name was engraved on the trophy.</notes>
