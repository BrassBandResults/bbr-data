The town of Scarborough appeared in holiday fashion, a large concourse of visitors being present on the occasion of a contest of brass bands. The following bands wore in attendance: Hartlepool, Farnley, Nafferton, Kirkstall, Scarborough, Oulton, Malton, Flockton, Dewsbury, Beverley, Batley, and Pudsey. The contest took place at two o&#39;clock, in the large saloon of the Rock Gardens, in which nearly 4,000 persons were comfortably seated during the afternoon. The music performed consisted chiefly of selections from operas - the exceptions being the Oulton band, who played the Hallelujah chorus in Handel&#39;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, and the Malton band, who played the two last choruses in the same oratorio. Several of the bands played exceedingly well, the opinion regarding one or two of them being in the minds of some gentlemen present that it is a difficult matter to meet with better bands even in the army. This remark may apply to the Kirkstall, Dewsbury, and Farnley bands, to which the first, second, and third prizes were awarded. The fourth and fifth prizes were taken by the Batley and Malton bands. The judges were Mr. Ernst Hartmann, bandmaster of the 10th Hussars, and Mr. Naylor, organist of the Parish Church and professor of music, Scarborough. 


A band contest was held at Scarbro&#39;, one of the bands entered being the First North York Volunteer band, which is also the band of the second battalion. An order for an inspection of Volunteers at Malton, by Lieut.-Col. Harman, on the day of the contest, was issued, which the band disregarded and proceeded to the contest. For thus absenting themselves the members are suspended until an inquiry shall take place. On the 11th inst. the battalion will be reviewed on Langton Wold.</notes>
