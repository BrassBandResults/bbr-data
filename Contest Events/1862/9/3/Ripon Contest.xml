RIPON FLORAL AND HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY&#39;S FETE - the third annual show of this society took place in a spacious field situated at the back part of Rose Villa, near to the Studley-road. The weather during the early part of the morning was somewhat threatening, but shortly before noon it cleared up, and the sun shone in full splendour consequently the ground was thronged 
a gay and fashionable company, including all the principal families in the city and neighbourhood. The great attraction of the day was the brass band contest when nine bands entered the lists, vis.: Mirfield, Silsden (16th W.R.V.), Harrogate, Leyburn. Marriner&#39;s Band (Keighley), Bramley, 4th Durham V.A.C. (West Hartlepool), Yorkshire Hussars (Ripon), 12th N.R.Y.V.(Redmire), and Armley. There were four prize - 1st, £12, 2nd, £7, 3rd, £5, 4th, £3, and were awarded as follows: Marriner&#39;s Band (Keighley); 1st, Leyburn, 2nd; Bramley, 3rd; and Silsden, 4th. The playing, as a whole, was very good. The Yorkshire Hussars Band disqualified themselves by introducing a clarionet. The judge was Mr. W. Jackson, professor of music, Bradford, and previously of Masham. The weather having cleared up, the fireworks were proceeded with.</notes>
