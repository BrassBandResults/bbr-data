  <notes>The scheduled 1949 Australian championships (the first held in Tasmania) were postponed until this date.

Timeline of events:
November 1948: Announced that the 1949 championship would be held in
Tasmania, the first time held there.
Originally scheduled: Venue - York Oval,  Launceston commencing 14th November 1949.
May 1949: Date changed to 24th-28th December 1949; 25 + bands anticipated to attend, 15 from interstate.
2nd November 1949: Championship abandoned due to poliomyelitis epidemic.
17th December 1949: Approval  from Australian Band Council to hold the 1949 championships on the following Easter (8th-10th April 1950).
It seems only 3 bands entered (all A Grade and from Victoria; Tasmania had no A Grade bands at the time).
The contest opened on Sunday 9th with the quickstep march for A grade; 8 local lower grade bands attended for display only.
Monday 10th  at 2pm: &quot;A&quot; grade played their test and O/C  selections.

No  lower grade contests were held.
3 bands only played.</notes>
