6 bands entered

Saturday was remarkably fine, and the attendance of visitors was as large if not larger than on the previous day. The brass band and the illuminations in the streets formed a very great attraction. The brass band contest, the first prize of which consisted of £12 in money and a bombardon in B flat, value £16 16s., was awarded to Kirkstall band; the second prize (£7 in money and a tenor horn in B flat, value £9 9s.) was won by the Black Dyke Mills band; the third prize (£5 in money and a soprano cornet in E flat, value £7 7s.) by the Saltaire band; and the fourth (£3), by Dodsworth&#39;s band, Bradford. The Jupiter cornet, value £9 9s., presented by Mr. F. Besson, of London, was awarded to Mr. Jackson, leader of the Kirkstall band, as the best solo cornet player in the contest. Each competitor for this prize was allowed to make his own selection.</notes>
