The attendance at this fete was remarkably good. Eight excursion trains were run from various places, and not a few availed themselves of the opportunity of visiting Fountains Abbey. The principal feature in the day&#39;s amusement was a brass band contest; there were four prizes offered, for which five bands competed. The following is the order in which the prizes were awarded; 1st, Dodsworth Band (Bradford); 2nd, York Rifle Band; 3rd, Highgate Mills Band; 4th, Knaresborough Band. The Cleckheaton Band was unsuccessful. Mr. Wm. Jackson, of Bradford, was the judge. The proceedings, as on the previous evening, concluded with dancing, and a display of fireworks by Professor Randles. (note: Cleckheaton Band did not compete - it was the Scholes Band that was unsuccessful)</notes>
