In addition to the exhibition a grand brass band contest took place, the names of the bands being the Matlock, the Ilkeston, and the Sutton-in-Ashfield. The first prize, a silver cornet, value thirteen guineas, was awarded to the Matlock; the second, a baritone, value ten guineas, to the Ilkeston; and the third, a euphonium, value seven guineas, to the Sutton-in-Ashfield. Tom Godrich, the celebrated comic singer, also appeared in character, and performed at intervals, much to the gratification of all. The amusements concluded with a grand display of fireworks by Professor Chadwick, of Ilkeston. Tea and other refreshments were provided by Mrs. Hewitt, of the Union Inn.
