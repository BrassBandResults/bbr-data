  <notes>Roy Newsome PhD thesis, p.73:
&quot;There is more detail about a second contest involving Besses o&#39; th&#39; Barn which took place, according to Hampson, on 21 June 1837 following a procession celebrating the coronation of Queen Victoria. The procession itself was organised by the Oddfellows, took place in Farnworth and involved &#39;four or five&#39; bands. This time there was an adjudicator - a local singer. There was also a draw for the order of play and a prize for the winner &#39;in the shape of a crown&#39;. As in 1821, each band played a piece of its own choice; Besses played &#39;Haill smiling morn&#39; and won the crown.&quot;</notes>
