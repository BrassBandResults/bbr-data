  <notes>Les Palmer, Reg Vardy Band wrote: &quot;This was sponsored by Greggs the Bakers and the trophy the Band won (a very heavy Bronze hand holding a stotty cake (Geordie delicacy)) is still in our Bandroom and is inscribed &quot;GREGGS BAKERY BRASS BAND CHALLENGE&quot; The contest was held on the back of an articulated lorry in Shields Road, Byker on Sunday, the 4th of July 1999 and we played an American themed program including Stars &amp; Stripes forever and an arrangement of America from West Side Story that ended with the Star Spangled banner, both of which we recorded for the Prince Bishops CD&quot;</notes>
