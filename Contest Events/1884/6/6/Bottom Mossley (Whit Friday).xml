  <notes>&quot;As a former member of Meltham &amp; Meltham Mills Band I once heard from someone (who first was a member in 1930) that this contest was actually a draw . It all started from the previous year when two men were bragging about who had the best band from their church at the Whit Friday morning procession of witness , and a wager was set of One Guinea to decide who had the best band . The adjudicator couldn&#39;t split them and it was declared a tie .&quot;</notes>
