  <notes>Mr Gladney did not turn up, so a local blind man was deputed to be the adjudicator. After each band had played the blind umpire was nonplussed and declared he could not decide on their respective merits, as all appeared so equal. Mr Gladney eventually appeared, shortly before 5pm, and the bands replayed their selections and he was able to give his awards.
1st contest promoted by South Notts Temperance Band.
Prizes - 1st £20, 2nd £12, 3rd £8, 4th £4.
4 bands competed</notes>
