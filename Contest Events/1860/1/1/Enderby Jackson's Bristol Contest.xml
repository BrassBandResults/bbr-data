There were three judges - an unknown Bandmaster from London, the Bandmaster of the Gardens in question and the Bandmaster of the 4th Dragoons. The number of Bands taking part was something between 20 and 30. Enderby Jackson announced that the first prize should have gone to Witney Band, but the judges concluded that they were professional men banded together for the occasion.</notes>
