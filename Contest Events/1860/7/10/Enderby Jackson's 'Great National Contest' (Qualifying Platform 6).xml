  <notes>Two bands qualified. Four of the six qualifying contests comprised 7 bands, with the remaining two comprising 8.
Bramley took 1st place on platform 6 and went forward to the &quot;Handel Orchestra&quot; final. They were then told they were disqualified from that as they had played the previous evening for the proprietor of the Cremorne Gardens. Despite not having been made aware of this condition they did not compete, but eventually regained the costs of their attendance from the organisers as some compensation.</notes>
