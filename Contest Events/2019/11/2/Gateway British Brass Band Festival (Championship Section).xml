Judging will be three adjudicators in the balcony of the auditorium behind a screen in secret as at NABBA.  A fourth judge will adjudicate section awards in the open in the lower bowl of the auditorium.  No communication will be allowed between judges.  Literature is Own Choice but must be a minimum of 20 minutes. Timing of the performance will be from the 1st note of music to cut off of each piece performed.  A 35 minute stage time is allotted each band with timing to begin when the 1st player steps on the performance area of the stage.  Timing ceases when the last brass member exits the stage. Bands must have traditional brass band instrumentation. Each judge will record real time audio files.  Awards will be directly following the close of the Championship Section competition by 5 pm.
