Ripon Floral and Horticultural Show. The principal attraction of the day was the Studley Pleasure-grounds. In the brass band contest eleven bands competed, viz., the South Hetton; 1st West Riding Artillery, Bramley; Mirfield; Silsden; Leyburn; Kirkstall; Mariners&#39; Band, Keighley; Farnley Iron Company&#39;s Temperance Band, Richmond, 17th West Riding Volunteer Band, Knaresborough, Yorkshire Hussars, Ripon. Mr. B. Clarke, band-master of the 16th Lancers, York, acted as judge, and awarded the prizes as follow: 1st, First West Riding Artillery, Bramley; 2nd, Marriner&#39;s Baud, Keighley; 3rd, Silsden; and 4th, Kirkstall. These awards gave entire satisfaction both to the public and the bands engaged. The balloon formed a great attraction. The disappointment in the non-ascent on the previous day (which arose from a slight accident over which the manager had no control), made yesterday&#39;s ascent doubly attractive, From an early hour in the afternoon partial ascents were made by several ladies and gentlemen, under the direction of Captain Orton. At five o&#39;clock a gun was fired as the signal for the final 11 ascent, the band struck up &quot;I&#39;m off to Charlestown,&quot; and away went the balloon, with Captain Orton, accompanied by Mr. Larkum, manager of the Ripon Gas Works, and amidst the deafening cheers of the spectators. The balloon rose rapidly, and took the direction of Thirsk. It was in sight for half an hour, but up to the time of the train leaving Ripon no intelligence had been hoard of the place of its descent. The proceedings of the day terminated with a grand ball.</notes>
