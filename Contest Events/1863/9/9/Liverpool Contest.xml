MANCHESTER AND LIVERPOOL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY BAND CONTEST 

To give additional eclat to the proceedings it was determined to have a band contest for prizes ranging from £3 to £15. Six bands entered into competition, each party playing its own tunes, but between the parts the whole played &quot;The Hallelujah Chorus&quot; in harmony, which had a fine effect, and elicited a round of applause. The judges were Mr. C. Burke, bandmaster of the 49th regiment, and Mr. S. E. Crowe, bandmaster of the 14th hussars, and they awarded the prizes as follows: Ist prize £15, Compstall Bridge, near Stockport; 2nd £10, Liverpool Press Guard; 3rd £5, Liverpool Amateurs; 4th £3, 1st Cheshire Artillery (Captain W. Laird&#39;s). The other competing bands were 1st Cheshire Engineers (Captain Hornblower&#39;s); and the 35th Cheshire Rifles, Bromborough Pool</notes>
