A spirited band contest took place at Richmond, in the beautiful park of Mr. Smurthwalte, Temple Grounds, under the auspices and for the benefit of the North York Volunteer Band of that town. The occasion was made a general holiday amongst the inhabitants, and a gay and fashionable company was attracted, there being about five thousand people present. Seven bands contested, the whole of whom played admirably. Four prizes were awarded, the Leeds Model Band taking the first of £15; Dodsworth&#39;s Bradford Band second, £8; Arkengarthdale Band third, £3; and the Leyburn Saxhorn Band fourth, £1. The awards appeared to give the greatest satisfaction. The playing of the Leeds band was loudly applauded at the end of each piece. The great beauty of the grounds, situated on the banks of the Swale, and surrounded on every side by great trees in fine foliage, adding much to the attraction of the contest.</notes>
