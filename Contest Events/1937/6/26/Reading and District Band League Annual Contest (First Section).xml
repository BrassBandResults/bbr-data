  <notes>Prizes - 1st £6, 2nd £4.
Deportment: Spring Gardens, judged by J. Pitts, Late Royal Berks. Regt.

4 bands competed.

The programme from which these results are taken is found copied in the centre pages of the 1978 Reading Band Festival programme, where it is incorrectly described as the programme for the first contest in that series (which event took place on 25th October 1930). The year is not given, but original reports demonstrate that it was 1937.</notes>
