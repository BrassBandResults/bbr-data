  <notes>Winner takes all prize - £1000

In order to celebrate their 70th birthday the famous fish and chip restaurant chain held eight Regional Championships, culminating in a two-day brass band festival featuring an invitation Masters for Championship Section bands competing for prize money totalling £9000. Eight brand new banding regions were created around Harry Ramsden&#39;s restaurants at which nationally graded 1st and 2nd Section bands competed in a specially devised Section &#39;A&#39;. Regional winners went on to battle it out for a &#39;winner takes all&#39; prize of £1000 in a Grand Section &#39;A&#39; Final. The Section &#39;A&#39; Champion was then invited to compete in Harry Ramsden&#39;s 70th Jubilee Masters the following day where the winning band took home £5000, with the second and third bands receiving £2500 and £1500 respectively. </notes>
