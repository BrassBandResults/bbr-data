  <notes>Page 10 British Bandsman 7th April 1923 - &quot;St Albans set the &#39;Lohengrin&#39; contest a-going. They had rattled through the first movement in fine style when an unusual incident occurred.  The judge&#39;s whistle sounded, the constable on duty at the tent became suddenly excited and ran towards the band, which ceased playing.  Much excited speculation ensued as to the cause of the sudden stop in the proceedings.  A great deal of running about by officials, a visit to the tent by the committee, and a breathless situation was at length relieved by the announcement that the judge (Tom Eastwood) had brought a score of &#39;Tannhauser&#39; - very careless indeed this - instead of one of &#39;Lohengrin&#39;.  A fresh start was made by the band, which got through a rattling good performance in which a rare bass end showed to much advantage.&quot;
