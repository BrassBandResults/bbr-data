Band Contest - Clay Cross
A band contest behalf of the funds of the Clay Cross Rifle Volunteer Band, came off, and was a complete success. The contest was held in a field adjoining the residence of Charles Binns Esq., and upwards of 4,000 persons paid for admission. The following bands competed: Matlock, Wednesbury, Nottingham Sax-Tuba, Dewsbury, Todmorden, Farnley Iron Company&#39;s, Leeds Model, Stainland, Bradford Model, Dodsworth, and Healey-Hall. The judges were Mr. Nicholson, of Leicester, and Mr. Farmer, of Nottingham. Some very excellent pieces were performed by each band. The judges awarded the prizes as follows: - Matlock R.V.C. (leader, Mr. Naylor), 1st prize, £20; Dewsbury band (leader; Mr.Peel), 2nd prize, £12; Dodsworth&#39;s band (leader. Mr. Dodsworth), 3rd prize, £8; Stainland band (leader, Mr. Jackson), 4th prize, £4; Healey-Hall (leader, Mr J. Law), 5th prize, £2. The Saynor family were in attendance, and enlivened the proceedings by their excellent performances. Other amusements were also provided. The weather turned out wet in the latter part of the day, much to the disappointment of the visitors. The contest lasted till after seven o&#39;clock. At the close the whole of the bands, with the exception of the Wednesbury, played &quot;God bless the Prince&quot; as arranged by Mr. W. Sipson, and the National Anthem. Mr. W. Sipson acted as conductor.</notes>
