Band Contest - Avenham Park, Preston
The festive proceedings in connection with the opening of Preston new town hall and public Park were resumed on by musical competition amongst 15 bands. In Avenham Park there was a grand brass band contest, bands from the following places playing: Over Darwen, Wedensfield, West Derby, Staffordshire (13th rifles), Todmorden, Bacup, Compstall, Saltaire, Healey Hall, and Heckmondwike. This contest was witnessed by a large number of persons. The judges were Mr. Martin, bandmaster 8th hussars, Manchester; Mr. Gladney, Bellevue, Manchester; and Mr. Prince, late bandmaster 17th regiment. After the general competition in Avenham Park, there was a contest by the solo cornet players belonging to seven of the bands for a beautiful electro-plated cornet and case (by Curtois), given by Mr. A. Chappell, New Bond-street, London. The contest was concluded about half-past five o&#39;clock. Afterwards the Mayor of Preston, with a party of ladies and gentlemen, arrived upon the ground, and when they had taken up their positions on the platform where the bands played, Mr. J. Norwood, the manager of the contest, announced the awards of the judges as follow: 1st prize (£40), Bacup band; 2nd (£15), Saltaire; 3rd (£10), Heckmondwike; 4th (£5), Healey Hall. Cornet prize: Mr. William Ellis, Over Darwen band.</notes>
