Agricultural Show + Band Contest - Skipton Castle
The thirteenth annual meeting of the Craven Agricultural Society was held at Skipton. As in former years, the extensive grounds adjoining the Castle were set apart for the show, and afforded admirable facilities for displaying the stock to the best advantage. Independent of the attractions of the show, amusements of a most varied character were provided in the show ground. A brass band contest was a source of never-failing interest. 

The band contest was taken part in by the following bands: 1, The Keighley (35th Airedale West York Rifle Volunteers); 2, Kirkstall: 3, Heckmondwike (Albion); 4,.Colne; 5, Kildwick; 6, Bacup (4th Lancashire Rifle Volunteers); and 7, Buttershaw Mills. The first prize, £26 5s, was awarded to No. 6; the second, £12 12s, was awarded to No. 3; the third, £6 6s, to No. 1: and the fourth, £3 3s., to No. 2.</notes>
