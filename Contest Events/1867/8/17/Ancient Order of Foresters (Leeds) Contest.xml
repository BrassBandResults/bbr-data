The Ancient Order of Foresters (Leeds district) held their annual gala at the Leeds Royal Park. In point of numbers (the weather being unfavourable for out-door attractions) the gathering was a failure, not more than 1,200 persons being present. Notwithstanding this drawback, the programme was carried out in its entirety, and. those present had no occasion to lament the very scanty attendance of visitors. The principal attraction was a brass band contest, which was carried out under the superintendence of Mr. H. Nicholson, of Leicester, who officiated as judge. The following bands took part in the competition: Heckmondwike Albion; Buttershaw Mills, near Bradford; Colne; New Holland, Lincolnshire; and Elland Upper Edge. The respective bands having played their allotted parts - which consisted of selections from Verdi, Balfe, Wallace, Gounod, &amp;c. - the prizes were awarded as follow: First, £15, Heckmondwike; second, £8, Buttershaw; third, £5, Colne; fourth, £2, Elland. A display of fireworks, by Professor Dyer, of London, brought the gala to a close.</notes>
