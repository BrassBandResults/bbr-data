Band Contest - Stockton-on-Tees
The third annual band contest under the auspices of the Excelsior Gala Company took place on the ground of the company in Oxbridge Lane when there were six bands entered for the various prizes, amounting in the aggregate to £65 divided into four prizes as follows: First £27, second, £20, third, £12, fourth, £6. During the early part of the day rain fell continuously and for some time was accompanied by thunder and lightning. As the day advanced however the storm moderated and in the course of the forenoon the sun shone and the weather was all that could be desired for outdoor amusements. At one o&#39;clock the bands mustered near the parish church and marched to the field. The attendance of the public was good, considering the dismal aspect of the morning. During the day the Stockton, Workhouse Drum and Fife Band played on the ground. Mr Edwin Swift of Huddersfield officiated as judge. The bands competing were: Staleybridge Old Band, 23 performers, conductor Mr Sourbutts; Saltaire Brass Band, 22 performers, conductor Mr J. Paley; 4th Durham (West Hartlepool) Artillery Band, 22 performers, conductor Mr T. Hogg; Felling Chemical Works Brass Band, 22 performers, conductor Mr Woods; Whitworth Brass Band, 21 performers, conductor Mr Woods; 1st Durham (Stockton) Rifle Volunteer Band also entered, but did not compete, being retained for the open-air ball in the evening. At the conclusion of the first parts, the bands united and played the Hallelujah Chorus. After the playing of the second parts, the judge awarded the prizes as follows: Staleybridge, 1st; Saltaire, 2nd; Whitworth, 3rd; 4th Durham Artillery,4th. The following then competed for the solo cornet prize of a splendid cornet, J. Paley, Saltaire, 1st; J. Peers, Stalybridge, 2nd; J. Kirkup, Felling; John Raine, Spennymoor; T. Hogg, West Hartlepool.</notes>
