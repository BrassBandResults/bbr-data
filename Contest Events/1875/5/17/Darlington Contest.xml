Gala + Band Contest - Woodside, Darlington
A gala and band contest was got up in connection with the Druids under the Witton Park equalised district. The gala was held at Woodside, which had been kindly lent by Mrs Gurney Pease. There were between 3,000 and 4,000 persons present who paid the admission fee. The chief attraction was the band contest. Eight bands competed, including Evenwood Model Band, Low Spennymoor, White Lea Colliery, Sunnybrow Band, 15th Durham (Darlington) Volunteers, Skelton-in-Cleveland Band, Londonderry Workshops Band, and Northallerton Temperance Brass Band. Two selections were played by each band, and the judge, .Mr C. Palmer, of South Shields, awarded the 1st prize of £12 to Sunnybrow; 2nd prize, £5, Northallerton Temperance; 3rd prize, £3, Evenwood Model Band. There was, as usual, some discontent on the part of losing bands with the judge&#39;s decision. </notes>
