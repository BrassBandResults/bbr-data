At the far end of the field, targets were erected for the practice of archery; and, during the afternoon, an accident occurred, a woman being struck with an arrow from the bow of not only an unskilful but also a cowardly archer, for as soon as he learned what he had done he ran out of the field, and was not seen after. The arrow struck the woman in a slanting direction, and, after it had entered the cheek, it glanced downwards, and want out near to the right side of the chin. The woman, however, was not seriously injured.
