It will be noticed that the well-known prizewinners, Black Dike Mills and Honley did not secure any prize, and that Kingston Mills only succeeded in obtaining the 5th prize. The judge&#39;s decision gave a good deal of dissatisfaction, and a most unseemly disturbance followed. There was loud hooting, and some members of the Black Dike Band behaved in an unruly and even threatening manner. One man suggested that they should play the &quot;Dead March&quot;, and this was no sooner said than several of the players of the Black Dike Band struck up the dirge in front of the judge&#39;s tent. 

It was found necessary for three police-constables to escort the judge to a cab in waiting, and then police-constable Newhill proceeded with him to the railway station. When the cab drove off there was mingled hooting and cheering, and one enthusiast threw a stone after the departing vehicle, but no damage was done. Arrived at the station, Mr. Holland had to wait several minutes for a train to Preston, whither he wished to go, and in the meantime some of the members of the Black Dike and Honley Bands had come on to the platform, and these began to taunt and hoot again. Mr. Holland was afraid that bodily harm would be done to him, and he was accompanied by a police-constable as far as Skipton.</notes>
