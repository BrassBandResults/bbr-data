  <notes>NB Reg Bishop was the brass adjudicator, but his band was in this section. The concert band championships were held concurrently and the adjudicator was Victor Grieve, who conducted a band in the Junior A Grade Concert Section, which also had three bands entered. As the two sections were running at the same time in different halls it seems likely that the adjudicators swapped halls so that they could conduct their own bands. Thus we suspect that Victor Grieve adjudicated this section.
