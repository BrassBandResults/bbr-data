The annual brass baud contest at Howley Ruins, near Batley. proved a great success. Ten bands had entered, but only five setes of competitors put in an appearance. A very large number of persons procured tickets of admission to the grounds. The result as declared by the judge, Mr. Smith, of Hull, was as follows: 
Meltham Mills Band, first prize, £20; Leeds Model, second £12; Dewsbury Old Band, third, £8, Dewsbury A1, fourth, £5; and West Vale Works Band, Greetland, fifth, £3. The next on the programme was a solo cornet contest, in which the competitors were Messrs. A. R. Monk, West Vale Works Band; James Pickard, Dewsbury Old Band; and John Sykes, Dewsbury A1 Band. The prize, one of Besson&#39;s first class cornets, value ten guineas, was awarded to Mr. Monk. Sports and pastimes took place on the hills during the afternoon, and at the close of the contest a gala was held, and a selection of dance music was played by the Batley brass band.
