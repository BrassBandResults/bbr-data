MELTHAM BRASS BAND CONTEST:- A brass band contest, arranged by the Meltham Mills Band, took place on Saturday, in a field adjacent to the Convalescent Home. Five prizes were offered, amounting to £60, and for these no less than eight bands entered for competition. Three of them, however, did not put in an appearance, viz., Trawden Band, Robin Hood Rifles, and Darwen Temperance Band. The contest was thus confined to the following bands:- Linthwaite, conductor, Mr. E. Swift ; Nelson, conductor, Mr. J. Nutter ; Bury Borough, conductor, Mr. Briggs ; Golcar, conductor, Mr. J. Garside ; Holme, conductor, Mr. J. Broadbent. Each band was allowed to play two pieces of its own selection, but not to play its second piece until the other bands had played their first pieces. Although there was a moderately large attendance, there was not such a large gathering as we expected to find ; and we doubt if the undertaking has proved a financial success. With regard to the music, the bands were not in their best form, although their second pieces showed an improvement … [illegible line] … that the first prize would be allotted to Linthwaite and the award of the judge, Mr. W. Williams, of Bath, justified the expectation. The prizes were awarded as follows:- 1st, Linthwaite, who played selection, &quot;Operatic Fantasia,&quot; Meverbeer, and selection &quot;Tannhauser,&quot; Wagner ; 2nd, Bury, who played selection, &quot;La Somnambula,&quot; Bellini, and selection, &quot;Macbeth,&quot; Verdi ; 3rd Nelson, who played selection, &quot;Stiffelio,&quot; Verdi ; and selection, &quot;Lucia de Lammermoor,&quot; Donizetti ; 4th, Holme, who played selection, &quot;Il Flauto Magico,&quot; Mozart, and selection, &quot;Cerencola.&quot; The refreshments were provided by the committee of management.
