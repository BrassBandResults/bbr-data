    <notes>Although an earlier contest in Sydney in 1880 had borne the same title, the Band Association of NSW ran its inaugural &quot;Intercolonial Band Contest&quot; in 1896. The second event, in 1897, was advertised as for the &quot;Championship of Australasia&quot;, and is considered to be the first in the sequence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://brassbandresults.co.uk/contests/AUSTRALIAN-CHAMPIONSHIPS/&quot;&gt;Australian national championships&lt;/a&gt; (noting that the federation of Australia did not occur until 1901).</notes>
