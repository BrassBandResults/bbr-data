  <venue id="2047">Lincoln Arboretum, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, UK</venue>
  <notes>The public feeling seemed to be that the Besses o&#39; th&#39; Barn Band was entitled to the first prize, and on the judge&#39;s decision being made known there was hooting, and more than one attempt was made to carry the platform upon which Mr. Dowdall was standing. Fortunately a number of policemen were enabled to keep the mob back, and advantage was taken of the people&#39;s attention being directed to a fight close by to hurry Mr. Dowdall towards the entrance gates. This move, however, was quickly perceived, and the judge was followed by an angry mob. It was with the greatest difficulty the police could keep the people from molesting him, and eventually they were compelled to place Mr. Dowdall in the Arboretum-keeper&#39;s lodge until a conveyance was obtained to take him to the Great Northern station. At the station the riotous proceedings were renewed, and Mr. Dowdall had to seek protection in the refreshment-room. &quot;The Dead March&quot; was played; and it was not until the police had succeeded in getting the judge into a compartment with some of the Kingston Mills Band that he was anything like safe. The affair caused great excitement the whole evening.
Prizes - 1st £25, 2nd £15, 3rd £10, 4th £7, 5th £3.
7 bands competed.</notes>
