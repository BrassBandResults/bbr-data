    <notes>Up to around 1967 this contest was held on the market square in Stalybridge, but was moved indoors one year when the proverbial biblical rain storm occurred. Was held in the Town Hall for a number of years before it moved to its present location at Stalybridge Labour Club I think about 25 years ago (but dont quote me on that). Although we have it recorded as two different contests it is a continuation and is still reported in the local press as being Stalybridge contest. </notes>
