UGLY INCIDENT : James Kelly ( B/M Hamilton ) was innocently involved inan ugly scene which erupted following a controversial decision by British adjudicator &amp; composer Dr. Cyril Jenkins ,
The judges decision was given in favour of the Townsville Railways Band who had previously won &quot;B&quot; grade under their conductor Albert Trembath. The Queensland band had been awarded one more point than the more fancied Hamilton band ( Kelly ) . When the result was announced it was greeted with disapproval from the large section of the crowd of thousands who had favoured Hamilton to win.
The demonstration lasted 20 minutes . Band officials &amp; police on duty became concerned for the safety of Mr. jenkins who refused to leave his tent .The situation was defused to a great extent when the Hamilton conductor was seen to enter the judges tent and after a lapse of time emerged arm in arm with Mr. Jenkins escorted by 6 police officers He was driven away from the ground .</notes>
