Brighouse Remarks:

Capital 0pening, fair precision and well in tune. Letter A Cornet and euphonium very well done, accompaniment steady. ff Basses good tone and well together, this movement being very well rendered by all. Andante mosso Cornet not clean enough, but accompaniments very nice; soprano excellent;. Piu agitate Band rather smart;, but ratten bar only moderately done. Allegro and slentando very creditably rendered. Andante religioso nicely in tune and good style. Allegro moderate Band very smart cadenza very well played. Maestoso Euphonium solo fair, but style rather stiff, accompaniments vary neat and nicely subdued, ff well taken up, but tone rather coarse, and trombones not always in tune. Letter G all right basses very good. Poco piu mosso Crescendo very well done. Tempo good, Allegro Pretty smart, cadenza, with the exception of a slip, was very nicely played indeed.  Andantino Cornet solo very tastefully played, but rather lacks confidence. Band accompaniments not always precise. Accelerando, however, is very well done. Allegro Band good, baritone and euphonium working well together. Unison bars approaching letter L very creditably  done, and rest of the movement good. Duo cadenza fairly played. Allegro maestoso Band opens well and in good style. The trombone plays very much out of tune solo evidently too much for him. This is a great pity for the band, as it completely spoiled the movement. Recit Band very precise, cadenza-beautifully phrased, the best I have heard so far. Allegro Cornet solo excellent and accompaniments nicely subdued. Basses very good. movement well rendered by all. Vivance Smartly played. The general playing of this band was indeed exceedingly good throughout, with the exception of the trombone, who is not good enough for the band. Should recommend the band to get a good player, and all will be well.</notes>
